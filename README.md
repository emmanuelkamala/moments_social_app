## Documentation

[Documentation of the API](#)

## Getting Started

Open your terminal or text editor and use next command

        git clone https://github.com/emmanuelkamala/Node_Express_API.git

        cd Node_Express_API

        Run 'npm install' command to install package dependencies.

## Run the app

To run the app and test the project; 
You will need a REST Client to test the endpoints. And for that I will recommend [Postman](https://postman.com/).

After downloading postman and installing it, then go to the root of the app enter this command on the command line:
'npm start'

Then open postman and use this link to start accessing the app:
http://localhost:3000/


After if you want to do any changes please create new branch, after changes open pull request.
Happy coding!
